# pricipal component analysis

Credits

In this tutorial by Code Heroku, the instructor explains the fundamental ML concept of principal component analysis along with a hands on demonstration of it using ScikitLearn and Python.

Again, I have added some comments in the code files stating my takeaways and the need for every step. Here, the only change I have made is converting the iterator returned by the zip() function to a list to be able to access the zeroth element of that particular list (for obtaining our reduced vector subset).
